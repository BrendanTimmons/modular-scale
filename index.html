        <p>When starting a design there are many considerations. Typography being the cornerstone of any good design can have huge effects on the overall feel. Choosing the typeface is only one step in the process. The sizes at which one composes their type can change the mood completely.</p>

        <h2>A history of scale</h2>

        <p>During the sixteenth century, European typographers devised a set of common sizes which remained nearly unchanged for 400 years. This scale became known as the classic typographic scale with a scaling ratio of two. Classic musical scales also share the same ratio where on a piano each C note vibrates twice as fast as the prior C note.</p>

        <h2>What defines a scale</h2>

        <p>A scale is made up by three things: base size, ratio, and number of steps. The base is multiplied or divided by the ratio which results in a series of harmonious steps. Continuing with the classic scale for example, selecting a base of 18 pixels yields the following:</p>

        <div class="compare-scales">
          <div class="compare-scale">
            <span class="compare-scale__item">
              <span class="compare-scale__size">9</span>
              <span class="compare-scale__text" style="font-size: 9px;">a</span>
            </span>
            <span class="compare-scale__item">
              <span class="compare-scale__size">18</span>
              <span class="compare-scale__text" style="font-size: 18px;">a</span>
            </span>
            <span class="compare-scale__item">
              <span class="compare-scale__size">36</span>
              <span class="compare-scale__text" style="font-size: 36px;">a</span>
            </span>
            <span class="compare-scale__item">
              <span class="compare-scale__size">72</span>
              <span class="compare-scale__text" style="font-size: 72px;">a</span>
            </span>
            <span class="compare-scale__item">
              <span class="compare-scale__size">144</span>
              <span class="compare-scale__text" style="font-size: 144px;">a</span>
            </span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>You can continue further up or down the scale for larger or smaller sizes that still maintain the same rhythm.</p>

        <h3>Finding a scale</h3>

        <p>There are many pre-existing scales that have been used over the centuries. Which one to use&horbar;or creating your own&horbar;is something a typographer must consider when beginning to compose. There are numerous scales some based on mathematical formulas such as &phi; (1:1618), &pi; (1:3.141) or based on musical scales to name a few: the classic scale (1:2), major third (4:5), augmented fourth (1:&radic;2).</p>
        
        <h3>Selecting a base</h3>

        <p>Once you have a typeface selected for your content you must establish a base. All typefaces are not created equal however, 16px on one does not make it&#8217;s size identical to another. Differing Em boxes on typefaces will change how the fonts are rendered at certain sizes. With this in mind experimenting with the size of your chosen font at differing sizes to find at which size it really shines.</p>

        <p>The body copy of this article uses Spectral from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral">google fonts</a>. Closely inspecting the sizes below, at 18px the arm on the T is blurry and at 16px the serifs on the Z are also blurry. 17px was the clear winner with the best looking size for rendering body copy with 15px being too small.</p>

        <h3>Time to get huge</h3>

        <p>Now that we&#8217;ve defined our base we can move onto our ratio. The choices made here are largely up to what kind of content or the overall feel. If you know that your titles are short and need impact then using ratios such as major twelfth (1:3) &pi; (1:3141) or double octave (1:4) will create very large differences between your headings and body copy.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <span class="quote">I&#8217;ve found that a variety of things can serve as an important number. The size at which caption text looks best [&hellip;] or a large number like the width of a piece of media [&hellip;] ensures that something about those elements resonates with the layout as a whole.</span>

        <p>For this article I have chosen augmented fourth (1:&radic;2) also known as dim fifth for obvious reasons&hellip;</p>
        
        <h2>The need for more</h2>
        
        <p>Sometimes the scale steps are too large and it would be useful to have something between 72px and 144px. This is where multi-stranded modular scales come in handy by introducing additional steps based on one or more additional base sizes.</p>

        <p>Chosing a second base shouldn&#8217;t be done at random. Finding something such as a citation, caption, even a video or image block that requires a fixed size can be a deciding factor. In this article I decided that I would like my blockquote citations to render at around 14px. So my two ratios </p>
